## Customization

This section covers how to customize your e-commerce template, including colors, fonts, and the project title. Customization is managed through the `theme.js` file and the `index.css` file.

1. **Customizing Colors**

   To customize the colors used in the application, edit the `palette` section in the `theme.js` file located in the `src/theme` directory. This section allows you to define the primary and secondary colors, text colors, and various status colors.

   ```javascript
   import { createTheme } from "@mui/material";

   const theme = createTheme({
     palette: {
       primary: { main: "#FF2681" },
       secondary: { main: "#26FFFF" },
       text: { primary: "#000000", secondary: "#707070" },
       status: {
         product: {
           "In stock": "#707070",
           "Few left": "#FF9000",
           "Out of stock": "#FF0000",
           other: "#FF0000",
         },
         order: {
           processing: "#0382FF",
           fulfilling: "#FF9000",
           fulfilled: "#15FF02",
         },
         payment: {
           paid: "#15FF02",
           failed: "#FF0000",
           pending: "#FF9000",
         },
         delivery: {
           pending: "#FF9000",
           delivered: "#15FF02",
           failed: "#FF0000",
         },
       },
     },
   });
   ```

2. **Customizing fonts**
   To change the fonts used in your application, modify the `typography` section in the `theme.js` file. This allows you to set different font families and weights for the primary and secondary fonts.

   ```javascript
   const theme = createTheme({
     typography: {
       fontFamily: "Your primary font, sans-serif",
       fontWeightLight: 200,
       fontWeightRegular: 500,
       fontWeightBold: 700,
       secondaryFont: {
         fontFamily: "Your secondary font, sans-serif",
         fontWeightLight: 200,
         fontWeightRegular: 400,
         fontWeightBold: 700,
       },
     },
   });
   ```

3. **Importing Fonts**

   The `index.css` file, located in the `src/styles` directory, is used to import fonts. Modify this file to include the fonts you want from [Google Fonts]("https://fonts.google.com/").

   ```css
   @import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=your+primary+font:ital,wght@0,400;0,700;1,400&family=your+secondary+font:wght@300..700&display=swap");
   ```

4. **Changing the Project Title**

   The project title is specified in the `title` attribute of the theme object in `theme.js`. This is your website name. To update the project title, change the value of the `title` attribute.

   ```javascript
   const theme = createTheme({
     title: "Your Custom Title",
     // other theme settings
   });
   ```

## Placeholder Data

The `lib/data` directory contains placeholder data to simulate various aspects of a database. This directory is to be deleted and but it's data serves as a guidline of what the front end is to receive from the API.

1. **user**

   The `lib/data/user.json` directory contains placeholder data representing user information. This data simulates user profiles, payment methods, addresses, recent activity, and more. Below is a detailed description of the data structure with JavaScript data types:
